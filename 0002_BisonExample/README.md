# A (very) simple Bison spec

## What is this?

A very simple Bison spec (even simpler than the Bison examples) that will generate a parser in C++. It *does* come with lots of comments, though.

## Why does it exist?

I found the Bison docs to be somewhat difficult to follow (especially for generating a C++ parser implementation), even to just get a basic parser up and running. Follow the docs I did, however, and the result is `Parser.yy` which is mostly my notes on why certain things work the way they do. Like other things, it is here for future reference.
